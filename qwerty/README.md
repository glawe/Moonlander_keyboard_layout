# Moonlander QWERTY Mac Layout

This is my personal keyboard layout for the Zsa Moonlander keyboard.
It's using standard english iso keys with the addition of the following
unicode keys:
* Å å
* Ä ä
* Ö ö
* ~ `

It's based on the source code from the [Oryx](https://www.zsa.io/oryx/) configurauion tool by Zsa.

https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/4J93z/latest/0

The reason for this is that I wanted to retain the physical symbols on 
the keyboard and avoid a nordic keymap.

## Important

Make sure you select 'Unicode Hex Input' as Input Source on your Mac.<br/>
