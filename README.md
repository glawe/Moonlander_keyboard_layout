# Moonlander QWERTY Mac Layout

This is my personal QMK Mac keyboard layout for the Zsa Moonlander keyboard.
It's using standard english iso keys with the addition of the following
unicode keys:
* Å å
* Ä ä
* Ö ö
* ~ `

It's based on the source code from the [Oryx](https://www.zsa.io/oryx/) configurauion tool by Zsa.

https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/4J93z/latest/0

The reason for this is that I wanted to retain the physical symbols on 
the keyboard and avoid a nordic keymap.
